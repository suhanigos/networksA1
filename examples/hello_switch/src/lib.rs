//! # hello_switch — your starting point
//!
//! This program compiles, installs on every switch, and runs to completion.
//! It also delivers almost nothing, and that is on purpose. It exists to
//! show you the three things every switch program is made of, and then to
//! get out of your way.
//!
//! Run it and read the report card:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
//! cargo run --features wasm --bin competitive_net_sim -- \
//!     run-world worlds/practice/practice-ring-002.toml \
//!     --program target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_switch.wasm \
//!     --score
//! ```
//!
//! You will see C1 delivery near 0% and C2 reachability at 0 pairs. Your
//! job in Part 1 is to turn both of those green.
//!
//! ## The three parts
//!
//! **`init`** builds the data plane. It runs once, before any traffic. You
//! declare your tables here and write the little pipeline program that will
//! touch every packet. The pipeline cannot think. It can load a field, look
//! it up in a table, and do what the table says.
//!
//! **`on_punt`** is your brain reacting to one packet. The pipeline punts a
//! packet when its tables do not know what to do with it. This is the only
//! way your program ever sees a packet, so it is the only way it ever learns
//! anything about the network.
//!
//! **`on_timer`** is your brain reacting to the clock. Use it to do things
//! nobody asked for: greet your neighbours, notice one has gone quiet,
//! recompute your routes.
//!
//! ## What this program does not do
//!
//! It never installs a route, so no packet is ever forwarded. It sends a
//! greeting to its neighbours but ignores every greeting it receives, so it
//! never learns who they are. It has no idea what the network looks like.
//!
//! All of that is yours to write.
